The **Music Library** serves as the main entry point to your entire music collection, providing a central place to browse, search, and play your audio content.

As you navigate through folders, the layout adapts based on the type of content being displayed. **Folders** are labeled with their names. **Playlists, images, and radio stations** are additionally highlighted for easier recognition.  

You can also filter the displayed content by entering text into the **Search in this page** box.

## Server Side Playlists

### Configure MY PLAYLIST sidebar

<Image src={imgMyPlaylist} alt="set my playlist video" />

To configure the quick access **MY PLAYLISTS** section, navigate to the folder containing your playlists, then click on the three dots in the header and select **set MY PLAYLIST**. The sidebar will be refreshed and the playlists are directly accessible.


### Create Server Side Playlist

To create a server-side playlist, first navigate to the folder where you want the playlist to reside. Next, click the three-dot menu located next to **MY PLAYLISTS**. A dialog box will appear where you can enter the name for your new playlist and confirm your choice.

<div class="flex items-center p-4 mb-4 text-sm text-blue-800 border border-blue-300 rounded-lg bg-blue-50 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-blue-400 dark:border-blue-800" role="alert">
  <svg class="shrink-0 inline w-4 h-4" aria-hidden="true" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 20 20">

  </svg>
  <span class="sr-only">Info</span>
  <div class="ps-6">
    If you create the playlist inside the configured **MY PLAYLISTS** folder, it will automatically appear in the Quick Access sidebar.
  </div>
</div>


### Add songs to Server Side Playlist

To add a song to a server side playlist, navigate to the desired song, click on the three dots to open the song options dialog, then select **Add to playlist** and select the desired playlist.

### Delete Server Side Playlist

Click the three-dot menu next to **MY PLAYLISTS** to open the options dialog. Select **Delete Playlist**, locate the playlist you want to remove, and click **Delete** to confirm.

### Example usage

<Image src={imgMyPlaylistCreateAdd} alt="create playlist and add song" />

In the animation below, you can see how to create a new playlist. Because we are working inside the folder that feeds the **MY FAVORITE** sidebar, the new playlist will automatically appear there. After creating it, weâ€™ll add and remove a few songs and finally delete the created playlist.

## View templates

### Album View

<Image src={imgA1} alt="" />

When browsing a container that contains only tracks from the same album, the interface switches to a track-based display.  

Clicking on a track title will immediately play that track rather than adding it to the current playlist.  

If the album is identified by a **MusicBrainz Release ID**, the like/dislike feature (heart icon) becomes available. Albums you mark as liked can then be quickly accessed from the **My Albums** section in the sidebar.

Songs can be rated from **1 to 5 stars** by clicking on the desired star icon. If a MusicBrainz user account is configured in the **App Settings**, your ratings can be submitted directly to [MusicBrainz.org](https://www.musicbrainz.org).

### Multi Disc Support

<Image src={imgMD} alt="" />

To manage a multi-disc release, copy all audio files into a single folder. If the tracks are tagged with the correct **numberOfThisDisc** ID3 metadata, the songs will be automatically sorted first by disc number and then by track ID.


###  Playlist view

<Image src={imgPV} alt="" />

When browsing server-based playlists, the display automatically switches to a track view with small album covers. Clicking **Switch View** will change the display to a full-sized album view.

## Song Options

<Image src={imgSO} class="size-64 shrink-0" alt="" />

Clicking the three-dot menu next to a song opens the **Song Options** dialog. Where you can choose between server side actions and media player actions.


export const Bullets = ({children, title}) => (
  <div>
    <h6 class="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">{title}</h6>
    <ul class="max-w-md space-y-1 text-gray-500 list-disc list-inside dark:text-gray-400">
      {children}
    </ul>
  </div>
);

<Bullets class="mt-8" title="Server side playlist actions">
    <li>Add to playlist</li>
    <li>Delete from this playlist</li>
</Bullets>

Both actions will be executed on the server side, so the changes will be reflected in the playlist file itself. The playlist has to be a `m3u` or `m3u8` file.

Removing songs can only be done, if the current view displays a playlist file.

<Bullets title="Player playlist actions">
    <li>Play next</li>
    <li>Add at last position</li>
</Bullets>

When the current media player is in **playlist mode**, selecting **Play Next** will add the song to the playback queue in the next position, while **Add at Last Position** will place the song at the end of the current renderer playlist. If the media player is **not in playlist mode**, the selected song will play immediately, regardless of which action is chosen.


<Bullets title="Other server actions">
    <li>Download</li>
    <li>Update Album Art</li>
</Bullets>

You can `download` a resource, or `Update Album Art` on the server side.


## UPnP Search

<Image src={search} alt="" />

If the selected media server supports UPnP search, entering text into the **Global Search** box will initiate a server-side search request.  

Known media servers with compatible UPnP search capabilities include [MinimServer](https://minimserver.com/) and [Universal Media Server (since 10.6.0)](https://www.universalmediaserver.com/). The search text is matched against tracks, albums, playlists, and artists. Artist covers are retrieved from Spotify if a connected account is available.

Clicking on a song item will play that song immediately. Clicking on any other item will navigate into that content.
