## View templates

### Album View

While browsing into an container that consists only of tracks of the same album the view switches to a track based display. 

Clicking on a title will play the selected track, <b>not</b> adding this item to the current playlist.

In case an album is identified by MusicBrainz-ReleaseId, the like/dislike feature (heart symbol) is activated.
Liked album can then be quick accessed by clicking on <code>My Albums</code> in the side bar.

Songs can be rated 1 to 5 by clicking on the desired star symbol. The rating can be send to <a href="https://www.musicbrainz.org">musicBrainz.org</a> if a user account is
configured in <code>app settings</code>. UMS server has the ability to store the rating information in the file itself if the audio file format is supported and
<code>audio_update_rating_tag = true</code> property is set in <code>UMS.conf</code>.

tagged with correct <b>numberOfThisDisc</b> ID3 comments.

or add songs to a renderer playlist.

export const Bullets = ({children, title}) => (
  <div>
    <h6 class="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">{title}</h6>
    <ul class="max-w-md space-y-1 text-gray-500 list-disc list-inside dark:text-gray-400">
      {children}
    </ul>
  </div>
);

<Bullets title="Server side playlist actions">
    <li>Add to playlist</li>
    <li>Delete from this playlist</li>
</Bullets>

Both actions will be executed on the server side, so the changes will be reflected in the playlist file itself. The playlist has to be a `m3u`
or `m3u8` file.

Removing songs can only be done, if the current view displays a playlist file.

<Bullets title="Player playlist actions">
    <li>Play next</li>
    <li>Add at last position</li>
</Bullets>

In case the current Media Player is in playlist mode, `Play next` will add the song to the playback queue at next position, 
`Add at last position` will add the song to the current renderer playlist at last position. Otherwise, the selected song will be played next, no matter
which action is selected.

<Bullets title="Other server actions">
    <li>Download</li>
    <li>Update Album Art</li>
</Bullets>

You can `download` a resource, or `Update Album Art` on the server side.

###  Playlist view

Browsing into server based playlists switches the display to a track view with small album covers. Clicking on <b>switch view</b> will change the display to an full sized
album view.

## UPnP Search

If the selected media server supports UPnP search, entering text into the <b>global search</b> box initiates a server side search request.

Known media server with compatible UPnP search capabilities are <a href="https://minimserver.com/">Minimserver</a>
and <a href="https://www.universalmediaserver.com/">Universal Media Server (since 10.6.0)</a>.
Text will be matched against tracks, albums, playlists and artists. Artist covers are looked up from Spotify, if account is connected.
