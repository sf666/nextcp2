## View templates

### Album View

While browsing into an container that consists only of tracks of the same album the view switches to a track based display. 

Clicking on a title will play the selected track, <b>not</b> adding this item to the current playlist.

In case an album is identified by MusicBrainz-ReleaseId, the like/dislike feature (heart symbol) is activated.
Liked album can then be quick accessed by clicking on <code>My Albums</code> in the side bar.

Songs can be rated 1 to 5 by clicking on the desired star symbol. The rating can be send to <a href="https://www.musicbrainz.org">musicBrainz.org</a> if a user account is
configured in <code>app settings</code>. UMS server has the ability to store the rating information in the file itself if the audio file format is supported and
<code>audio_update_rating_tag = true</code> property is set in <code>UMS.conf</code>.

### Multi Disc Support

Copy all audio files of your multi disc release in one folder. Songs will be sorted by disk and then by track ID, if songs are
tagged with correct <b>numberOfThisDisc</b> ID3 comments.

###  Playlist view

Browsing into server based playlists switches the display to a track view with small album covers. Clicking on <b>switch view</b> will change the display to an full sized
album view.

## Song Options

Clicking on the three dots will open song options dialog. Here you can add or remove songs to or from playlists,
or add songs to a renderer playlist.

<Image src={imgSO} class="size-64 shrink-0" alt="" />

export const Bullets = ({children, title}) => (
  <div>
    <h6 class="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">{title}</h6>
    <ul class="max-w-md space-y-1 text-gray-500 list-disc list-inside dark:text-gray-400">
      {children}
    </ul>
  </div>
);

<Bullets class="mt-8" title="Server side playlist actions">
    <li>Add to playlist</li>
    <li>Delete from this playlist</li>
</Bullets>

Both actions will be executed on the server side, so the changes will be reflected in the playlist file itself. The playlist has to be a `m3u`
or `m3u8` file.

Removing songs can only be done, if the current view displays a playlist file.

<Bullets title="Player playlist actions">
    <li>Play next</li>
    <li>Add at last position</li>
</Bullets>

In case the current Media Player is in playlist mode, `Play next` will add the song to the playback queue at next position, 
`Add at last position` will add the song to the current renderer playlist at last position. Otherwise, the selected song will be played next, no matter
which action is selected.

<Bullets title="Other server actions">
    <li>Download</li>
    <li>Update Album Art</li>
</Bullets>

You can `download` a resource, or `Update Album Art` on the server side.


## UPnP Search

If the selected media server supports UPnP search, entering text into the <b>global search</b> box initiates a server side search request.

Known media server with compatible UPnP search capabilities are <a href="https://minimserver.com/">Minimserver</a>
and <a href="https://www.universalmediaserver.com/">Universal Media Server (since 10.6.0)</a>.
Text will be matched against tracks, albums, playlists and artists. Artist covers are looked up from Spotify, if account is connected.
