Download current <a href="https://github.com/sf666/nextcp2/releases">release</a> into a folder of your choice. Make sure to use JDK 17 or later. Start the application by calling

<code>java -jar nextcp2-release.jar</code>. For Windows user an exe file is provided for download (experimental). For Linux/Unix systems
with systemd service manager installed a service template <a href="https://github.com/sf666/nextcp2/tree/main/startup-services/systemd">
  can be downloaded here
</a> for starting nextcp/2 as a service.

      After launching the application navigate with your browser to <code>http://server-ip-address:8085</code>. If the application is started on the local machine
      browse to <code>http://127.0.0.1:8085</code>. If port 8085 is already in use, edit the file <code>nextcp2config.json</code> located next to your jar file and
      change property <code>embeddedServerPort</code> to an available port. Further configuration can be done within the application itself.

      After first startup it is recommended to configure a default client configuration which means choosing a default media server and a default media renderer by
      navigating to <code>App Settings</code>. Create <code>NEW PROFILE</code> and rename it to a meaningful name, select server and renderer, then press the save button.

      In case of using the recommended <a href="https://www.universalmediaserver.com/">Universal Media Server (UMS)</a> as media server, unlock API features by editing UMS
      configuration file <code>UMS.conf</code> and add
      <ul>
        <li><code>audio_update_rating_tag = true</code> // If rating should be saved within the audio file (metadata section). Default is false.</li>
        <li><code>audio_likes_visible_root = true</code> // If "My Albums" should be located in the root folder next to the library folder. Default is false</li>
      </ul>
