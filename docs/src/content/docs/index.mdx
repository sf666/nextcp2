NextCP/2 is a web-based UPnP control point built for audio playback. Unlike most control point applications that run on a single device,
NextCP/2 can be installed on a network server device — such as a NAS, file server, or Raspberry Pi — providing simultaneous access from any 
device within the local network.

This design allows users to control their music library from multiple devices, including smartphones, tablets, and computers, 
without the need for individual installations on each device.
