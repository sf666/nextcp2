NextCP/2 is a web-based UPnP control point designed specifically for audio playback. Unlike most control point applications that run on a single device, 
NextCP/2 can be installed locally or on a network server deviceâ€”such as a NAS, file server, or Raspberry Pi. When installed on a server, it allows simultaneous 
access from any device within the local network.
