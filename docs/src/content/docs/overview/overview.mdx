This control point put's it focus on providing the best user experience for audio enthusiasts. Controlling other content is also supported but with less UI
awareness.

Please keep in mind, that only the <a href="https://github.com/ik666/UniversalMediaServer">Universal Media Server (UMS) fork</a>
supports all additional features and is therefore the recommended media server.

### Why is the fork needed

The current (version 14 and later) implementation of Universal Media Server (UMS) is focused on video users (TV's) and lacks several features that are essential for a modern media server experience. The fork aims to address these shortcomings by introducing enhancements and new functionalities that cater to the needs of audiophile users.

One significant benefit over the original implementation is a correct renderer identification in a 3 box setup which is widely used by users focused on listening to audio files.
This means you can use nextCP/2 but also your favorite control point app like `BubbleUPnP` or `LINN App` to control your UPnP streaming device.

In faviour of the 3-box setup, the "authorization" implementation of UMS had to be disabled.

### Additional features supported by UMS fork

<Aside type="tip">The features listed below are supported on the server side. This means you don't have to copy your files between your media library and you client machine or mount a network drive. The UMS fork handles all the actions initiated by nextCP/2 on the server side!</Aside>

#### Like Music Albums

Music albums can be liked / disliked in case the music files are tagged with a musicBrainz release ID. You can i.e. use <a href="https://picard.musicbrainz.org/">Picard</a> to tag your files accordingly.
