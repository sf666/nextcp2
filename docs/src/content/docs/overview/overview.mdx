This control point put's it focus on providing the best user experience for audio enthusiasts. Controlling other content is also supported but with less UI
awareness.

Please keep in mind, that only the <a href="https://github.com/ik666/UniversalMediaServer">Universal Media Server (UMS) fork</a>
supports all additional features and is therefore the recommended media server.

### Why is the fork needed

The current implementation of Universal Media Server (UMS), starting from version 14, is primarily optimized for video playback on TVs. However, it lacks several key features necessary for a modern and versatile media server experience. This fork aims to address these limitations by introducing enhancements and new functionalities tailored to the needs of audiophile users.

One major improvement over the original implementation is accurate renderer identification in a three-box setup—a configuration widely used by users who prioritize high-quality audio playback. With this enhancement, you can control your UPnP streaming device not only via nextCP/2 but also through your preferred control point applications, such as BubbleUPnP or the LINN App.

To support the three-box setup, the original UMS "authorization" feature has been disabled.

### Additional features supported by UMS fork

<Aside type="tip">The features listed below are supported on the server side. This means you don't have to copy your files between your media library and you client machine or mount a network drive. The UMS fork handles all the actions initiated by nextCP/2 on the server side!</Aside>

#### Like Music Albums

Music albums can be liked or disliked if the audio files are tagged with a MusicBrainz Release ID. You can use tools such as <a href="https://picard.musicbrainz.org/">Picard</a> to apply the appropriate tags.

Liked music albums are indicated by a pink heart icon in the button bar. You can quickly access any liked album through the My Albums link in the sidebar.

#### Star Rating Support

Many types of resources can be rated using a star system, with ratings ranging from 1 to 5 stars.

##### Audio Resources Rating
Star rating information is stored in the audio file’s metadata and can be utilized by other tools.

Additionally, audio files tagged with a MusicBrainz Track ID can export this rating information to your personal MusicBrainz account. To enable this feature, you must provide your username and password.

#### Server Side Playlist support

Clicking the <span class="material-symbols-outlined">pending</span> icon in the sidebar opens a dialog where you can create or delete playlists stored on the server’s file system.
New playlists are created in the currently displayed folder.

Clicking the &#x22EE; button displays additional song options.

When you create a new playlist or add songs to an existing one, a dialog will appear allowing you to select the desired playlist.
